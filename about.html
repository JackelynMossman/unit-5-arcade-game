                    <p>I am just a girl with an untamed spirit, an opinion larger than life and an unapologetic cry baby when I watch the TV series "This Is Us".</p>
                    <p>I am a mother of a 20 year old daughter whoâ€¦much to her chagrin did not fall far from this tree. I am a mother of a recently passed away 10 year Golden Retriever who loved unconditionally, was as soft as a pillow, and could out fart and burp any person I know.                    </p>
                    <p>I am a beer snob...Craft not Crap (A little game I made up and am happy to share the rules). I smoke cigars, love white chocolate, hate the rain, am made of cheese and will accept any cooking challenge put forth to me.  Bring it!</p>
                    <p>I have traveled my whole life, most often solo, since I was in grade 8.  My parents were very trusting, I stayed in Mexico with a couple girlfriends, no parents, for a month in grade 9.  I lived in Japan and went to school in grade 10 & 11 and also worked there after I graduated...so much experience before I turned 19.</p>
                    <p>I was lucky, very lucky to have had such amazing parents who offered up life altering experiences on a silver platter. They worked their asses off to give my sister and I everything that was needed to become happy well rounded humans.  They are, by the way, still happily married.  46 years later, they still date and <strong><em>go parking</em></strong>.  My dad  still makes her giggle and blush. <img src="img/heart.jpg" alt="It was worth it" title="It was worth it"></p>
