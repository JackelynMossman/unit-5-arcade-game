## Unit 5: Object-Oriented Programming ##
**Classic Arcade Game**
This is a simple game built to test a users ability to cross the street and avoid a collision with the moving objects.

### Rules of the Game ###

### Construction ###
* I used my original Unit 3 Project Submission as the base website for this arcade game project (Classic Arcade Game).
* Using Javascript Object-Oriented Programming.
* Utilizing Class Functions and Prototypes, as well as using the keyword 'this' within my classes and class prototype functions.
* I adjusted the js/engine.js file to append the Canvas to the mainwrapper div class for better placement of the arcade game canvas. (@ Line 30)
